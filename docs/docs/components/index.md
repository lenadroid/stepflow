# Components

Each step in the workflow executes a specific component.
Components are provided by plugins.
The most common component plugins are described below.

* Built-in components are provided by StepFlow and provide useful building blocks such as evaluation of sub-flows, looping, and conditional execution.
* The component protocol is a JSON-RPC protocol for a component server to provide components.
* Tools provided by MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers can also be used as components.
